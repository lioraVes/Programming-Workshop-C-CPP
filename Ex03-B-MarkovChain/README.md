## Project Description
This project generates tweets and genreates possible paths in a snakes and ladders game using markov chains.
If the user wants to generate tweets, the program needs to get a number of arguments:
- seed value
- number of tweets to generate - n.
- path to the corpus file- a file that contains sentences (tweets).
- number of word to read from the file.
  
If there isnt a 4th parameter the program reads the whole file.

The program generates n tweets with maximal length of 20 words.

If the user wants to play snakes and ladders the arguments are:
- seed value
- number of paths to generate

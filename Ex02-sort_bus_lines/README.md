## Project Description
This is a bus line sort project.
The program gets as a parameter if the user wants to sort the bus lines by quick sort or bubble sort or if he wants to test the program.
Then, the program asks for the number of lines and for each line the user will have to give the information:
- line number
- distance
- duration

And finally the program will sort the lines.
If the user wanted to sort by bubble sort, the program sorts the lines by distance.
If the user wanted to sort by  quick sort, the program sorts the lines by duration.

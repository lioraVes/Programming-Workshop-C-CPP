## Project Description
This project generates tweets using markov chains.
The program gets a number of arguments:
- seed value
- number of tweets to generate - n.
- path to the corpus file- a file that contains sentences (tweets).
- number of word to read from the file.

If there isnt a 4th parameter the program reads the whole file.

The program generates n tweets with maximal length of 20 words.
